Getting Started with Django Course
==================================

A course from [Talk Python Training](https://training.talkpython.fm/). Sign up
at [Getting Started with Django](https://training.talkpython.fm/courses/all) (??? FIXME).


Course Summary
--------------

[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) is one of the most popular web
frameworks for coding in Python. It includes libraries for: templating HTML
content, URL routing, views, a robust Object Relational Model (ORM) for
mapping classes to database queries, HTML form management, a built-in
administrative tool, and much more. This course teaches you how to build your
first Django project and guides you through the key parts of the library.


Application Development Approach
--------------------------------

This course is constructed around a project called **Alexandria**, a virtual
library.  Each chapter covers a new Django concept, but it also adds a feature
to the application. As you proceed through the course you will not only learn
more about Django but also be building features and tests as you would for
developing real world software.


Topics
------

In this course you will about:

* Setting up a new project
* Django project structure
* The database ORM, including: common fields, writing queries, Foreign Keys 
and related objects, and light-weight migrations
* Function based views: the code that responds to the browser
* HTML Templates
* User management: creating users, managing logins, password resets, and the
* built-in admin for users
* Data management: loading / saving database fixtures
* URL routing
* HTML Forms: GET vs POST, submitting data to server, and using the forms library
* Considerations when deploying Django
* Third party libraries: a quick tour of popular libraries and how to install them
